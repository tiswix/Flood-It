# Flood It

## Project description
"Flood It" is a game realized in the C# programming language that uses a width-first search algorithm as the main component of the game.

## Main idea of the project
My idea was to examine the perspectives and actuality of using algorithms to write programs. Since algorithms can greatly simplify the writing of game logic or help to organize certain actions.
The main idea is to show people that algorithms are not outdated and can be used in gaming and other areas.

## Relevance and scope of application
As an example of using the algorithm, I created my own game, the essence of which is to repaint more cells of the game board in one color. During the game, you compete with the computer.
I decided to choose the option with the game board, as it is represented as a two-dimensional matrix. I believe that it will be much easier to explain the work of the algorithm using a matrix than using graphs. I offer it to specialized lyceums to study certain elements in programming. Or for children who want to play logic games.

## Results
The research has shown that algorithms are quite relevant and quite convenient to use for writing program logic. As a result of the research, I created a game using the width-first search algorithm that can be used as an entertainment element. Or it can be used by teachers to explain certain elements of programming to children who are learning programming

## Possible directions for project development
* rewrite for Android and iOS operating systems
* the ability to change the size of the field
* change the difficulty if it is a game against a computer
* adding accounts so that you can play with friends.
* create a mode for the learning process so that you can see how the algorithm analyzes the field during each move
